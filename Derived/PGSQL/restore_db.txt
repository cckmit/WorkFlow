restore activiti database from backup 
  pg_restore -1 -v -p 5432 -U postgres -d activiti 05092018_TPFDVOPS_QA_activiti_database_backup.sql

restore workflow db from backup 
  pg_restore -1 -v -p 5432 -U postgres -d workflow <backup file name>

restore raw database from backup
verify and connect to each database and verify count of tables, indexes etc
connect to secondary postgresql instance as postgres user 
  psql -U postgres -h localhost
    DROP DATABASE ACTIVITI;
    DROP DATABASE WORKFLOW;
    \l
  - list databases to verify 

restore activiti database from backup
restore workflow db from backup
verify and connect to each database and list tables
ENABLE replication between databases


PLEASE note that due to the small size of the database, replication need not have to be stopped and restore can be done to the primary postgresql instance only. This needs to be tested , please ensure replciation continues to work after the DROP and restore of databases
